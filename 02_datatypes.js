"use strict" //treat all the code as newer version of JavaScript
// once activated the strict mode can't be deactivated in the whole file and its by default set use strict mode.

// Premitive Datatype

let name = 'Anurag' //string datatype
let age = '20' //integer datatype
let isLoggedIn = false //boolean datatype

// the integer falls in range of 2^53 it is treated as integer and beyond that it is treated as bigint

// null is standalone value and also a datatype. lets take an example, you are creating a temperature app which asks form server about the temperature, now there is some problem in the server and it can't send temp so you will send null as an value.

// undefined is a datatype assigned when the values are not given to variables

// symbols => is used to define the uniqueness of something. we will discuss later


console.log(typeof 'hitesh')
console.log(typeof null) // data type of null when asked with typeof gives object
console.log(typeof undefined)
