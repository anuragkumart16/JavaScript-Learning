        1. type: 
           - Description: The type of the event (e.g., 'click', 'mouseover').
           - Example: event.type

        2. timestamp: 
           - Description: The time at which the event was created.
           - Example: event.timeStamp

        3. defaultPrevented: 
           - Description: Indicates whether the event's default action has been prevented.
           - Example: event.defaultPrevented

        4. target: 
           - Description: A reference to the object that dispatched the event.
           - Example: event.target

        5. toElement: 
           - Description: The element the pointer is moving to (only for mouse events).
           - Example: event.toElement

        6. srcElement: 
           - Description: The element that triggered the event (similar to target).
           - Example: event.srcElement

        7. currentTarget: 
           - Description: The element to which the event handler is attached.
           - Example: event.currentTarget

        8. clientX: 
           - Description: The horizontal coordinate within the application's client area at which the event occurred.
           - Example: event.clientX

        9. clientY: 
           - Description: The vertical coordinate within the application's client area at which the event occurred.
           - Example: event.clientY

        10. screenX: 
            - Description: The horizontal coordinate of the event relative to the screen.
            - Example: event.screenX

        11. screenY: 
            - Description: The vertical coordinate of the event relative to the screen.
            - Example: event.screenY

        12. altKey: 
            - Description: Indicates whether the 'Alt' key was pressed when the event was triggered.
            - Example: event.altKey

        document.getElementById('link').addEventListener('click',(e)=>{
            e.preventDefault()  //it stops the link to do its default behaviour to carry us to the href page.
            console.log('link was clicked')
